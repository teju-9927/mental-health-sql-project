Project Overview :
This project analyzes mental health trends in the tech industry using SQL.
Using data from the OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey, I performed SQL-based analysis to answer questions like:
•	What percentage of people sought mental health treatment by country or continent?
•	How do mental health benefits vary by company size?
•	Are remote workers more or less likely to seek treatment?
•	Which countries had respondents with access to workplace support?
The project demonstrates skills in:
•	Data aggregation using COUNT, SUM, AVG
•	Filtering with WHERE, HAVING
•	Grouping and ranking with GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT
•	Combining results using UNION
•	Joining tables using JOIN with a custom continent reference table
